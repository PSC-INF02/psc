Clady hurt his left foot Sunday when New York Giants defensive lineman Cullen Jenkins rolled up on him while the Broncos were trying to run out the clock in their 41-23 win. Clady will soon undergo surgery for what's being called a Lisfranc tear, which involves a separation of ligaments and joints in the foot.

Chris Clark, a fifth-year journeyman, will take the place of Clady - the undisputed leader on the line - and make his first career start at left tackle Monday night when the Broncos (2-0) host the Oakland Raiders (1-1).

''Stepping up into a role like this, it's not going to be hard for me to adjust,'' said Clark, who received a two-year contract extension on Monday. ''It's not about filling a guy's shoes for me. It's about me creating my legacy, just helping the team the best way I can and doing my job.''

Still, those are some big cleats for Clark to fill.
